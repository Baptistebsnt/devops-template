# System Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the architecture of our DevOps infrastructure and application deployment system.

## Infrastructure Architecture

    subgraph Cloud Provider[AWS]
        S3[S3 Bucket]
        DynamoDB[DynamoDB]
        EC2[EC2 Instances]
        RDS[RDS Database]
    end

    subgraph CI/CD Pipeline
        GitHub[GitHub Repository]
        Actions[GitHub Actions]
        Docker[Docker Registry]
    end

    subgraph Monitoring
        Prometheus[Prometheus]
        Grafana[Grafana]
        ELK[ELK Stack]
    end

    GitHub --> Actions
    Actions --> Docker
    Docker --> EC2
    EC2 --> RDS
    EC2 --> S3
    EC2 --> DynamoDB
    EC2 --> Prometheus
    Prometheus --> Grafana
    EC2 --> ELK
```

## Application Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Frontend
        Web[Web Application]
        API[API Gateway]
    end

    subgraph Backend
        App[Application Server]
        Cache[Redis Cache]
        DB[(PostgreSQL)]
    end

    subgraph Infrastructure
        LB[Load Balancer]
        CDN[CDN]
        WAF[WAF]
    end

    CDN --> LB
    LB --> WAF
    WAF --> Web
    WAF --> API
    API --> App
    App --> Cache
    App --> DB
```

## Deployment Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Development
        Dev[Dev Environment]
        Local[Local Development]
    end

    subgraph Staging
        Stage[Staging Environment]
        Test[Testing]
    end

    subgraph Production
        Prod[Production Environment]
        DR[Disaster Recovery]
    end

    Local --> Dev
    Dev --> Stage
    Stage --> Prod
    Prod --> DR
```

## Monitoring Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Data Collection
        Metrics[Metrics Collection]
        Logs[Log Collection]
        Traces[Trace Collection]
    end

    subgraph Processing
        Prometheus[Prometheus]
        Logstash[Logstash]
        Jaeger[Jaeger]
    end

    subgraph Visualization
        Grafana[Grafana]
        Kibana[Kibana]
    end

    subgraph Alerting
        Alerts[Alert Manager]
        Notifications[Notification Channels]
    end

    Metrics --> Prometheus
    Logs --> Logstash
    Traces --> Jaeger
    Prometheus --> Grafana
    Logstash --> Kibana
    Prometheus --> Alerts
    Alerts --> Notifications
```

## Key Components

1. **Infrastructure**

   - AWS Cloud Infrastructure
   - Terraform for Infrastructure as Code
   - Docker for containerization
   - Kubernetes for orchestration (planned)

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**

   - GitHub Actions for automation
   - Docker for container builds
   - Automated testing and deployment

3. **Monitoring**

   - Prometheus for metrics
   - Grafana for visualization
   - ELK Stack for logging
   - Alert Manager for notifications

4. **Database**

   - PostgreSQL for primary data store
   - Redis for caching
   - Automated backups and recovery

5. **Security**
   - WAF for web application protection
   - SSL/TLS encryption
   - IAM for access control
   - Secrets management

## Data Flow

1. **Development Flow**

   - Code changes pushed to GitHub
   - Automated tests run in CI pipeline
   - Docker images built and stored
   - Deployment to development environment

2. **Production Flow**

   - Code promotion from staging
   - Automated deployment to production
   - Health checks and monitoring
   - Rollback capabilities if needed

3. **Monitoring Flow**
   - Metrics collected from all services
   - Logs aggregated and processed
   - Alerts triggered based on thresholds
   - Dashboards updated in real-time
