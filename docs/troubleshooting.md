# Troubleshooting Guide

This document provides solutions for common issues encountered during development, deployment, and operations.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Database Connection Issues

#### Symptoms

- Application cannot connect to database
- Database operations timing out
- Connection pool exhausted

#### Solutions

1. Check database service status:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/database/db_operations.sh status
   ```

2. Verify connection parameters:

   ```bash
   echo "DB_HOST: $DB_HOST"
   echo "DB_PORT: $DB_PORT"
   echo "DB_NAME: $DB_NAME"
   echo "DB_USER: $DB_USER"
   ```

3. Test database connectivity:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/database/db_operations.sh test-connection
   ```

4. Check for network issues:
   ```bash
   ping $DB_HOST
   telnet $DB_HOST $DB_PORT
   ```

### Deployment Failures

#### Symptoms

- Deployment script fails
- Services not starting
- Health checks failing

#### Solutions

1. Check deployment logs:

   ```bash
   tail -f /var/log/deployment.log
   ```

2. Verify environment variables:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/tests/verify_deployment.sh
   ```

3. Check service status:

   ```bash
   systemctl status application
   docker ps
   ```

4. Review recent changes:
   ```bash
   git log -p
   ```

### Performance Issues

#### Symptoms

- Slow response times
- High CPU usage
- Memory leaks

#### Solutions

1. Check system metrics:

   ```bash
   top
   htop
   ```

2. Analyze application logs:

   ```bash
   grep "ERROR\|WARN" /var/log/application.log
   ```

3. Check database performance:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/database/db_operations.sh analyze
   ```

4. Monitor network traffic:
   ```bash
   netstat -tulpn
   ```

## Error Messages and Solutions

### Database Errors

#### "Connection refused"

- Verify database service is running
- Check firewall settings
- Confirm correct port number

#### "Authentication failed"

- Verify database credentials
- Check user permissions
- Reset password if necessary

#### "Database does not exist"

- Create database if missing
- Verify database name
- Check connection string

### Application Errors

#### "Service unavailable"

- Check service status
- Verify dependencies
- Review error logs

#### "Timeout error"

- Increase timeout settings
- Check network connectivity
- Optimize slow queries

#### "Memory error"

- Increase memory limits
- Check for memory leaks
- Optimize resource usage

## Monitoring and Logging

### Checking Logs

1. Application logs:

   ```bash
   tail -f /var/log/application.log
   ```

2. System logs:

   ```bash
   journalctl -u application
   ```

3. Docker logs:
   ```bash
   docker logs <container_id>
   ```

### Monitoring Tools

1. Grafana dashboards:

   - CPU Usage
   - Memory Usage
   - Disk I/O
   - Network Traffic

2. Prometheus metrics:

   - Service health
   - Response times
   - Error rates

3. ELK Stack:
   - Log analysis
   - Error patterns
   - Performance trends

## Network Issues

### Common Network Problems

1. DNS Resolution:

   ```bash
   nslookup example.com
   dig example.com
   ```

2. Connectivity:

   ```bash
   ping example.com
   traceroute example.com
   ```

3. Port Availability:
   ```bash
   netstat -tulpn | grep <port>
   lsof -i :<port>
   ```

### Firewall Issues

1. Check firewall rules:

   ```bash
   iptables -L
   ufw status
   ```

2. Verify port access:
   ```bash
   telnet <host> <port>
   nc -zv <host> <port>
   ```

## Security Issues

### Authentication Problems

1. Check user credentials
2. Verify token validity
3. Review access logs

### Permission Issues

1. Check file permissions:

   ```bash
   ls -la
   ```

2. Verify user groups:

   ```bash
   groups
   id
   ```

3. Review ACLs:
   ```bash
   getfacl <file>
   ```

## Backup and Recovery

### Backup Issues

1. Verify backup creation:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/database/db_operations.sh verify <backup_file>
   ```

2. Check backup storage:

   ```bash
   df -h
   du -sh /backup
   ```

3. Test restore process:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/database/db_operations.sh restore <backup_file>
   ```

### Recovery Procedures

1. Identify last good backup
2. Prepare recovery environment
3. Execute restore process
4. Verify data integrity

## Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization

1. Analyze query performance:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/database/db_operations.sh analyze-queries
   ```

2. Check index usage:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/database/db_operations.sh analyze-indexes
   ```

3. Monitor slow queries:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/database/db_operations.sh monitor-slow-queries
   ```

### Application Optimization

1. Profile application:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/performance/profile.sh
   ```

2. Monitor resource usage:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/performance/monitor.sh
   ```

3. Analyze bottlenecks:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/performance/analyze.sh
   ```
